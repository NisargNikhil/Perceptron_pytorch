Project Title:

Perceptron model using Pytorch

About:

This is a very simple perceptron model trained with Pytorch for distinguishing between two distinct group of blobs with 
the label 0 and 1.After training the model the straight line efficiently bisects the two blobs.

Dataset used:

The dataset has been created using sklearn's library "datasets". 100 random sample of points was generated keeping centers
for one blob at [-0.5,0.5] and second blob at [0.5,-0.5] 

Library used:

Torch
Numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
torch.nn
sklearn
